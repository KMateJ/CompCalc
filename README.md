# Complex Calculator in C

Welcome to the **CompCalc** project! This repository is dedicated to building a calculator in C, designed to explore and understand the inner workings of compilers, including lexers, parsers, and expression evaluation.

## Features

- **Custom Lexer and Parser**: Learn how to tokenize and parse mathematical expressions.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Support for complex calculations including nested operations and operator precedence.
- **Extendable Design**: A modular structure to add more functionality as the project evolves.

## Objectives

This project is an educational exercise aimed at understanding:
- The construction of lexers and parsers.
- Expression evaluation techniques.
- Building a small domain-specific language (DSL).
